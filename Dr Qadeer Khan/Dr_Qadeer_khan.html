    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan">Abdul Qadeer Khan (About this soundlisten); Urdu: عبد
        القدیر خان‎; born 1 April 1936) NI, HI, FPAS, DEng, known as A. Q. Khan, is a Pakistani nuclear physicist and
        metallurgist who is colloquially known as the "father of uranium enrichment project" for his nation's atomic
        bomb program – though he was only part of a team who developed the technology. In public circles, Khan is known
        both for his scientific ability and for his difficult interpersonal relations and volatile personality.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan">An from India who migrated to Pakistan in 1951, Khan was
        educated in Western Europe's technical universities in metallurgical engineering where he pioneered studies in
        phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges. After
        learning of India's 'Smiling Buddha' nuclear test in 1974, Khan joined his nation's clandestine efforts to
        develop atomic weapons when he founded the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976, and was both its chief
        scientist and director for many years.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan">In January 2004, Khan was subjected to a debriefing by the
        Musharraf administration over the evidence of nuclear proliferation handed over by the Bush administration of
        the United States. Khan admitted his role in running the proliferation network[vague] – only to retract his
        statements in later years when he leveled accusations at the former administration of Pakistan's Prime Minister
        Benazir Bhutto in 1990, and also directed allegations at the President Musharraf over the controversy in 2008.
        After years of house arrest, Khan successfully filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government of Pakistan at the
        Islamabad High Court whose verdict declared his debriefing unconstitutional and freed him on 6 February 2009.

    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan">The United States reacted negatively over the verdict,
        rendered by Chief Justice Muhammad Aslam, when the Obama administration issued an official statement warning
        that Khan still remained a "serious proliferation risk".</p>

    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan">Abdul Qadeer Khan was born on 1 April 1936 in Bhopal, a
        city then in the erstwhile British Indian princely state of Bhopal State, and now the capital city of Madhya
        Pradesh. His family is of Orakzai (a Pashtun tribe) origin. His father, Abdul Ghafoor, was a schoolteacher who
        once worked for the Ministry of Education, and his mother, Zulekha, was a housewife with a very religious mind.
        His older siblings, along with other family members, had emigrated to Pakistan during the bloody partition of
        India (splitting off the independent state of Pakistan) in 1947, who would often write to Khan's parents about
        the new life they had found in Pakistan.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan">After his matriculation from a local school in Bhopal, in
        1952 Khan emigrated from India to Pakistan on the Sind Mail train, partly due to the reservation politics at
        that time, and religious violence in India during his youth had left an indelible impression on his world view.
        Upon settling in Karachi with his family, Khan briefly attended the D. J. Science College before transferring to
        the University of Karachi where he graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics with a
        concentration on solid-state physics.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Qadeer_Khan" id="end">From 1956 to 1959, Khan was employed by the
        Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (city government) as an Inspector of weights and measures, and applied for a
        scholarship that allowed him to study in West Germany. In 1961, Khan departed for West Germany to study material
        science at the Technical University in West Berlin where he academically excelled in courses in metallurgy, but
        left West Berlin when he switched to the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in 1965. In 1967,
        Khan obtained an engineer's degree in Materials technology – an equivalent to a Master of Science (MS) offered
        in English-speaking nations such as Pakistan – and joined the doctoral program in metallurgical engineering at
        the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium.</p>
