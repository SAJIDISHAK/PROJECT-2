    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">(born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 – 11
        September 1948) was a barrister, politician and the founder of
        Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan's independence
        on 14 August 1947, and then as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death. He is revered in Pakistan as
        Quaid-E-Azam ("Great Leader") and Baba-E-Qaum, ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is a national holiday in
        Pakistan.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as
        a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London. Upon his return
        to British India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which
        eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first
        two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim
        unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which
        Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a
        fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims. In 1920, however, Jinnah
        resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political
        anarchy.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of
        the Indian subcontinent should have their own state to
        avoid the possible marginalised status they may gain in a Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim League,
        led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation. During the Second World War, the
        League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after
        the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not
        reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties to agree
        to the independence of a predominantly Hindus India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">As the first Governor-General of Pakistan, Jinnah worked
        to establish the new nation's government and policies,
        and to aid the millions of Muslim migrants who had emigrated from the new nation of India to Pakistan after
        independence, personally supervising the establishment of refugee camps. Jinnah died at age 71 in September
        1948, just over a year after Pakistan gained independence from the United Kingdom. He left a deep and respected
        legacy in Pakistan. Innumerable streets, roads and localities in the world are named after Jinnah. Several
        universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Jinnah's name. According to his biographer, Stanley Wolpert,
        Jinnah remains Pakistan's greatest leader.</p>

    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">Jinnah's given name at birth was Mahomedali Jinnahbhai,
        and he likely was born in 1876, to Jinnahbhai
        Poonja and his wife Mithibai, in a rented apartment on the second floor of Wazir Mansion near Karachi, now in
        Sindh, Pakistan but then within the Bombay Presidency of British India. Jinnah's family was from a Gujarati
        Khoja Shi’a Muslim background, though Jinnah later followed the Twelver Shi'a teachings. After his
        death, his relatives and other witnesses claimed that he had converted in later life to the Sunni sect. His
        religion at the time of his death was disputed in multiple court cases. Jinnah was from a wealthy merchant
        background, his father was a merchant and was born to a family of textile weavers in the village of Paneli in
        the princely state of Gondal (Kathiawar, Gujarat); his mother was also of that village. They had moved to
        Karachi in 1875, having married before their departure. Karachi was then enjoying an economic boom: the opening
        of the Suez Canal in 1869 meant it was 200 nautical miles closer to Europe for shipping than Bombay.
        Jinnah was the second child; he had three brothers and three sisters, including his younger sister
        Fatima Jinnah. The parents were native Gujarati speakers, and the children also came to speak Kutchi and
        English. Jinnah was not fluent in Gujarati, his mother-tongue, nor in Urdu; he was more fluent in
        English. Except for Fatima, little is known of his siblings, where they settled or if they met with
        their brother as he advanced in his legal and political careers.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">As a boy, Jinnah lived for a time in Bombay with an aunt
        and may have attended the Gokal Das Tej Primary School
        there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the
        Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his
        matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a
        large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare
        time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street
        lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed
        surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale that the young Jinnah discouraged other children from playing
        marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.

    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">In 1892, Sir Frederick Leigh Croft, a business associate
        of Jinnahbhai Poonja, offered young Jinnah a London
        apprenticeship with his firm, Graham's Shipping and Trading Company. He accepted the position despite the
        opposition of his mother, who before he left, had him enter an arranged marriage with his cousin, two years his
        junior from the ancestral village of Paneli, Emibai Jinnah. Jinnah's mother and first wife both died during his
        absence in England. Although the apprenticeship in London was considered a great opportunity for Jinnah, one
        reason for sending him overseas was a legal proceeding against his father, which placed the family's property at
        risk of being sequestered by the court. In 1893, the Jinnahbhai family moved to Bombay.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">Soon after his arrival in London, Jinnah gave up the
        business apprenticeship in order to study law, enraging his
        father, who had, before his departure, given him enough money to live for three years. The aspiring barrister
        joined Lincoln's Inn, later stating that the reason he chose Lincoln's over the other Inns of Court was that
        over the main entrance to Lincoln's Inn were the names of the world's great lawgivers, including Muhammad.
        Jinnah's biographer Stanley Wolpert notes that there is no such inscription, but inside (covering the wall at
        one end of New Hall, also called the Great Hall, which is where students, Bar and Bench lunch and dine) is a
        mural showing Muhammad and other lawgivers, and speculates that Jinnah may have edited the story in his own mind
        to avoid mentioning a pictorial depiction which would be offensive to many Muslims. Jinnah's legal education
        followed the pupillage (legal apprenticeship) system, which had been in force there for centuries. To gain
        knowledge of the law, he followed an established barrister and learned from what he did, as well as from
        studying lawbooks. During this period, he shortened his name to Muhammad Ali Jinnah.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">During his student years in England, Jinnah was
        influenced by 19th-century British liberalism, like many other
        future Indian independence leaders. His main intellectual references were peoples like Bentham, Mill, Spencer,
        and Comte. This political education included exposure to the idea of the democratic nation, and
        progressive politics. He became an admirer of the Parsi British Indian political leaders Dadabhai Naoroji
        and Sir Pherozeshah Mehta. Naoroji had become the first British Member of Parliament of Indian extraction
        shortly before Jinnah's arrival, triumphing with a majority of three votes in Finsbury Central. Jinnah listened
        to Naoroji's maiden speech in the House of Commons from the visitor's gallery.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah">The Western world not only inspired Jinnah in his
        political life, but also greatly influenced his personal
        preferences, particularly when it came to dress. Jinnah abandoned local garb for Western-style clothing, and
        throughout his life he was always impeccably dressed in public. His suits were designed by Savile Row tailor
        Henry Poole & Co. He came to own over 200 suits, which he wore with heavily starched shirts with detachable
        collars, and as a barrister took pride in never wearing the same silk tie twice. Even when he was dying, he
        insisted on being formally dressed, "I will not travel in my pyjamas." In his later years he was usually
        seen wearing a Karakul hat which subsequently came to be known as the "Jinnah cap".</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah" id="end">Dissatisfied with the law, Jinnah briefly
        embarked on a stage career with a Shakespearean company, but resigned
        after receiving a stern letter from his father. In 1895, at age 19, he became the youngest Indian to be
        called to the bar in England. Although he returned to Karachi, he remained there only a short time before
        moving to Bombay.</p>
