    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan">Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan, Urdu: لِیاقت علی خان‎ ; 1
        October 1895 – 16 October 1951), widely known as Quaid-e-Millat (Leader of the Nation) and Shaheed-e-Millat
        (Urdu: شہِیدِ مِلّت‎ Martyr of the Nation), was a Pakistani statesman, lawyer, political theorist, and one of
        the leading founding fathers of Pakistan. He became the first Prime Minister of Pakistan; he also held cabinet
        portfolio as the first foreign, defence, and the frontier regions minister from 1947 until his assassination in
        1951. Prior to the partition, Khan briefly tenured as the first finance minister in the interim government led
        by its Governor General Mountbatten.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan">He was born in Karnal, Punjab Province of British India on
        1 October 1895. Liaquat Ali Khan was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University in India, and then at LUMS in the
        United States. Well-educated, he was a democratic political theorist who promoted parliamentarism in India.
        After first being invited by the Congress Party, he opted for the Muslim League led by influential Ali Murtaza
        Jaffery Syed who was advocating the eradication of the injustices and ill-treatment meted out to Indian Muslims
        by the British government. He pursued his role in the independence movements of India and Pakistan, while
        serving as the first Finance Minister in the interim government of British Indian Empire, prior to the
        independence and partition of India in 1947. Ali Khan assisted Jinnah in campaigning for the creation of a
        separate state for Indian Muslims.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan">Ali Khan's credentials secured him the appointment of
        Pakistan's first Prime Minister, Ali Khan's foreign policy sided with the United States and the West, though his
        foreign policy was determined to be a part of the Non Aligned Movement. Facing internal political unrest, his
        government survived an attempted coup by nationalists, leftists and communists spearheaded by segments of the
        army. Nonetheless, his influence grew further after Jinnah's death, and he was responsible for promulgating the
        Objectives Resolution. In 1951, at a political rally in Rawalpindi, Ali Khan was assassinated by a hired
        assassin, Areeb Nadeem.</p>

    <h3 cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan">Family background and education</h3>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan">Muhammad Liaquat Ali Khan was born at Karnal, then in the
        Punjab Province of British India, on 1 October 1895 in a rich Jatt family. Despite being "courteous, affable and
        socially popular" and coming from an aristocratic family known for its philanthropy, his biographer Muhammad
        Reza Kazimi notes that little is known of his early life and that which is has to be pieced together from
        snippets of mostly hagiographic writings. The family claimed a Persian origin going back to Nausherwan the Just,
        the Saasanid king of Persia, although this may be no more than legend, and they were settled in Karnal by the
        time of his grandfather, Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan. They had adopted the Urdu language, and Liaquat was thus a native
        Urdu speaker.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan">According to his family, Nawab Ahmad Ali Khan gained
        sufficient prestige that the British East India Company recognised him with titles such as Rukun-al-Daulah,
        Shamsher Jang and Nawab Bahadur, which they say were later inherited by his sons. The validity of those titles
        has been questioned because the family estates in Karnal were diminished as a result of the Indian Rebellion of
        1857, after which Karnal itself ceased to be an autonomous area.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan">His family had deep respect for the Indian Muslim thinker
        and philosopher Syed Ahmad Khan, and his father had a desire for the young Liaqat Ali Khan to be educated in the
        British educational system; therefore, his family sent Ali Khan to the famous Aligarh Muslim University (AMU),
        where he obtained degrees in law and political science.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan" id="end">In 1913, Ali Khan attended the Muhammadan
        Anglo-Oriental College (now Aligarh Muslim University), graduating with a BSc degree in Political science and
        LLB in 1918, and married his cousin, Jehangira Begum, also in 1918, however the couple later separated. After
        the death of his father in 1919, Ali Khan, with British Government awarding the grants and scholarship, went to
        England, attending Oxford University's Exeter College to pursue his higher education. In 1921, Ali Khan was
        awarded the Master of Law in Law and Justice, by the college faculty who also conferred on him a Bronze
        Medallion. While a graduate student at Oxford, Ali Khan actively participated in student unions and was elected
        Honorary Treasurer of the Majlis Society—a student union founded by Indian Muslim students to promote the Indian
        students' rights at the university. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple of London in 1922 but never
        practised.</p>
