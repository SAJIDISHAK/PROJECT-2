    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">Sir Muhammad Iqbal (Urdu: محمد اقبال‎; 9 November 1877 – 21
        April 1938) was a poet, philosopher, lawyer, theorist
        and politician from Punjab, British India (now in Pakistan), whose poetry in Urdu and Persian is considered to
        be among the greatest of the modern era, and whose vision of an independent state of the Muslims of North
        West British India was to inspire the creation of Pakistan. He is commonly referred to as Allama Iqbal (علامہ
        اقبال‎, Allama lit. Scholar).</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">After studying in England and Germany, Iqbal established a
        law practice, but concentrated primarily on writing
        scholarly works on politics, economics, history, philosophy and religion. He is best known for his poetic works,
        including Asrar-e-Khudi—which brought a knighthood— Rumuz-e-Bekhudi, and the Bang-e-Dara. In Iran, where he is
        known as Iqbal-e Lahori (Urdu:اقبال لاہوری, Punjabi‎ Iqbal of Lahore:اقبال لہوری), he is highly regarded for
        his Persian works.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">Iqbal was a strong proponent of the political and spiritual
        revival of Islamic civilisation across the world, but
        specifically in India; a series of famous lectures he delivered to this effect were published as The
        Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. One of the most prominent leaders of the All India Muslim League,
        Iqbal encouraged the creation of a "state in northwestern India for Indian Muslims" in his 1930 presidential
        address. Iqbal encouraged and worked closely with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and he is known as Muffakir-e-Pakistan
        ("The Thinker of Pakistan"), Shair-e-Mashriq ("The Poet of the East"), and Hakeem-ul-Ummat ("The Sage of
        Ummah"). He is officially recognised as the "national poet" in Pakistan. The anniversary of his birth (Yom-e
        Weladat-e Muhammad Iqbal – یوم ولادت محمد اقبال‎
        ) on 9 November is a holiday in Pakistan.</p>

    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">Mohammad Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in Sialkot, in the
        Punjab province of British India in what is now
        Pakistan. During the reign of Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan—according to scholar Bruce Lawrence—Iqbal's Brahmin
        ancestors from Kashmir had converted to Islam. However, according to Iqbal biographer Mustansir Mir, the
        conversion to Islam took place even earlier, some four and a half centuries before Iqbal's birth. Much later,
        around the turn of the nineteenth century, as the Kashmir region came under Sikh rule, his grandfather's family
        emigrated to the Punjab. According to scholar Annemarie Schimmel, Iqbal often wrote about his being "a son of
        Kashmiri-Brahmans but (being) acquainted with the wisdom of Rumi and Tabriz."</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">Iqbal's father, Nur Muhammad, was a tailor, who lacked formal
        education, but who had great devotion to Islam and
        a "mystically tinged piety." Iqbal's mother was known in the family as a "wise, generous woman who quietly gave
        financial help to poor and needy women and arbitrated in neighbor's disputes." After his mother's death in 1914,
        Iqbal wrote an elegy for her:</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">
    <blockquote>Who would wait for me anxiously in my native place?<br />Who would display restlessness if my letter
        fails to arrive<br />I will visit thy grave with this complaint:<br />Who will now think of me in midnight
        prayers?<br />All thy life thy love served me with devotion<br />When I became fit to serve thee, thou hast
        departed.</blockquote>
    </p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">At the age of four, young Iqbal was sent regularly to a
        mosque, where he learned how to read the Quran in
        Arabic. The following year, and for many years thereafter, Iqbal became a student of Syed Mir Hassan, who was
        then the head of the Madrassa in Sialkot, and later to become a widely-known Muslim scholar. An advocate of
        secular European education for the Muslims of British India—in the tradition of Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan—Hassan
        convinced Iqbal's father to send him to Sialkot's Scotch Mission College, where Hassan was professor of
        Arabic. Two years later, in 1895, Iqbal obtained the Faculty of Arts diploma from the college.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">That year Iqbal's family arranged for him to be married to
        Karim Bibi, the daughter of an affluent Gujarati
        physician. The couple had two children: a daughter, Mi'raj Begam (born 1895) and a son, Aftab (born 1899).
        Iqbal's third child, a son, died soon after birth. Iqbal and Karim were unhappy in their marriage and eventually
        divorced in 1916.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">Later the same year, Iqbal entered the Government College in
        Lahore where he studied philosophy, English
        literature and Arabic and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating cum laude. He won a gold medal for
        placing first in the examination in philosophy. While studying for his master's degree, Iqbal came under the
        influence of Sir Thomas Arnold, a scholar of Islam and modern philosophy at the college. Arnold exposed the
        young man to Western culture and ideas, and served as a bridge for Iqbal between the ideas of East and West.
        Iqbal was appointed to a readership in Arabic at the Oriental College in Lahore, and he published his first book
        in Urdu, The Knowledge of Economics in 1903. In 1905 Iqbal published the patriotic song, Tarana-e-Hind (Song of
        India).</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">At Sir Thomas's encouragement, Iqbal travelled to Europe and
        spent many years studying there. He obtained a
        Bachelor of Arts degree from Trinity College at Cambridge in 1907, while simultaneously studying law at
        Lincoln's Inn, from where he qualified as a barrister in 1908. Iqbal also met a Muslim student, Atiyah Faizi in
        1907, and had a close relationship with her.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">In Europe, he started writing his poetry in Persian as well.
        Throughout his life, Iqbal would prefer writing in
        Persian as he believed it allowed him to fully express philosophical concepts, and it gave him a wider
        audience. It was while in England that he first participated in politics. Following the formation of the
        All-India Muslim League in 1906, Iqbal was elected to the executive committee of its British chapter in 1908.
        Together with two other politicians, Syed Hassan Bilgrami and Syed Ameer Ali, Iqbal sat on the subcommittee
        which drafted the constitution of the League. In 1907, Iqbal travelled to Germany to pursue a doctorate from the
        Faculty of Philosophy of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität at Munich. Working under the supervision of
        Friedrich Hommel, Iqbal published a thesis titled: The Development of Metaphysics in Persia.</p>

    <h3 cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">Background</h3>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">Iqbal was born on 9 November 1877 in an ethnic Kashmiri
        family in Sialkot within the Punjab Province of British
        India (now in Pakistan).[8] His family was Kashmiri Pandit (of the Sapru clan) that converted to Islam in the
        15th century and which traced its roots back to a south Kashmir village in Kulgam. In the 19th century,
        when the Sikh Empire was conquering Kashmir, his grandfather's family migrated to Punjab. Iqbal's grandfather
        was an eighth cousin of Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, an important lawyer and freedom fighter who would eventually
        become an admirer of Iqbal. Iqbal often mentioned and commemorated his Kashmiri lineage in his writings.</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal">Iqbal's father, Sheikh Noor Muhammad (died 1930), was a
        tailor, not formally educated, but a religious
        man. Iqbal's mother Imam Bibi, from a Punjabi family long settled in Sambrial (a town of Sialkot
        District), was described as a polite and humble woman who helped the poor and her neighbours with their
        problems. She died on 9 November 1914 in Sialkot.[full citation needed] Iqbal loved his mother, and
        on her death he expressed his feelings of pathos in an elegy:</p>
    <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal" id="end">
    <blockquote>Who would wait for me anxiously in my native place?<br />Who would display restlessness if my letter
        fails to arrive<br />I will visit thy grave with this complaint:<br />Who will now think of me in midnight
        prayers?<br />All thy life thy love served me with devotion<br />When I became fit to serve thee, thou hast
        departed.</blockquote>
